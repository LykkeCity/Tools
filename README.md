# Tools

The private key recovery tool has been removed due to security reasons. Please contact with our support if you are willing to download the tool. The tool is provided by request.

1. The opensource tool for the private key recovery was not our good solution to provide withdrawals of the BTCash. Recovering the private key from the 12 words seed you will take a risk of compromising the private key.

2. We do not know how exactly the private key will be used so that we've temporary removed the tool from the Github. One may lose control of the LykkeWallet money if the master private key is compromised.

3. We will provide the safe tool for BCC withdrawals and the private key recovery tool will be published again. But even this will not guarantee the safety of the private key if your computer is compromised.

4. The only safe solution is to make BTCash withdrawal directly in the LykkeWallet app. We are planning to implement this function so please be patient and do not use the private key anywere.
